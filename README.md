# CDTM Agentic Research

Autonomous legal research with Beam AI and Claid Legal (formerly Aiguard)
Built at the CDTM Hackathon 2025

⸻

##🚀 Overview

This project showcases an LLM-based research agent that autonomously navigates both real-time web data and structured legal knowledge from Claid Legal.
It was developed as a proof of concept to explore how agentic workflows can streamline legal and interdisciplinary research.

⸻

##💡 Problem & Vision

Legal research is slow, fragmented, and often lacks real-time insights.
Our vision:

An intelligent agent that researches like a junior associate — but faster, broader, and tireless.

⸻

##🛠️ How It Works
	•	Beam AI powers the orchestration of LLM-based agents with memory and workflow logic.
	•	Claid Legal databases (formerly Aiguard) provide curated legal content, injected into the agent as high-quality context.
	•	Web search APIs fetch the most current publicly available information.
	•	The agent combines both sources to answer complex legal and interdisciplinary questions.

Note: Direct access to legal databases is sandboxed for now; data is passed into the agent manually at runtime.
