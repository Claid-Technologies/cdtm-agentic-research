# CDTM Agentic Research

Autonomous legal research with Beam AI and Claid Legal (formerly aiguard)
Built at the CDTM Hackathon 2025



## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases an LLM-based research agent that autonomously navigates both real-time web data and structured legal knowledge from Claid Legal.
It was developed as a proof of concept to explore how agentic workflows can streamline legal and interdisciplinary research.



## 💡 Problem & Vision

Legal research is slow, fragmented, and often lacks real-time insights.
Our vision:

An intelligent agent that researches like a junior associate — but faster, broader, and tireless.



## 🛠️ How It Works

- Beam AI powers the orchestration of LLM-based agents with memory and workflow logic.
- Claid Legal databases (formerly aiguard) provide curated legal content, injected into the agent as high-quality context.
- Web search APIs fetch the most current publicly available information.
- The agent combines both sources to answer complex legal and interdisciplinary questions.

Note: Direct access to legal databases is sandboxed for now; data is passed into the agent manually at runtime.
